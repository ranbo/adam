The Adam Game!

Isabel was our foreign exchange student from Spain.
She never had an older brother to torment, so when
we asked her to go downstairs to tell Adam it was time for dinner,
she took great delight in calling out "Adam! Adam!
A-DUM! A-DUM! Adamadamadamadamadam!!!"

Adam was always very chill in his response to this.

So I decided to make a song about it. Adam said, "You can't have too many Adams in a song."
I replied, "We'll see."

Instead of creating a music video to go with this song,
I thought it would be fun to make a video game out of it instead.

## Back story:

Isabel was our foreign exchange student from Spain.
She never had an older brother to torment, so when we asked her 
to go downstairs to tell our son Adam that it was time for dinner,
she took great delight in calling out "Adam! Adam! A-DUM! A-DUM! 
Adamadamadamadamadam!!!"

Adam was always very chill in his response to this.

One day at a dinner for the exchange students, Adam, Isabel and I
were standing in line to eat, and Isabel turned to Adam and said,
"Adamadamadamadamadam".

Meanwhile, Adam calmly replied, "Yes? May I help you?".

So I decided to make a song about it. Adam said, "You can't have too many Adams in a song."
I replied, "We'll see."

After writing the ground-breaking lyrics and recording a first draft
of the song, I had Isabel sing her part. Then I invited Adam in to
record him. "Say 'Yes?'", I told him, and he did so. Then I said,
"Say 'Oh, ok.'", and he complied. "Ok!" I told him, "That will do."

He laughed as he looked at this big complicated Logic Pro project,
and said, "Yeah, don't worry about any of the rest of this!"

When it was done, I played the song for him and the rest of the family
and ever since then, our family has often said Adam more times than
necessary when addressing him.

Instead of creating a music video to go with this song,
I thought it would be fun to make a video game out of it,
which I did for his 31st birthday.

<div id="backstory">

  When COVID first hit, our oldest son Adam happened to be staying with us
  for a few months while he was waiting for his next apartment to be ready.<p>

  Isabel was our wonderful foreign exchange student from Spain, and she was
  staying with us at that same time.<p>

  She never had an older brother to torment, so when we asked her
  to go downstairs to tell our son Adam that it was time for dinner,
  she took great delight in calling out "Adam! Adam! A-DUM! A-DUM!
  Adamadamadamadamadam!!!"<p>

  Adam was always very chill in his response to this.<p>

  One day at a dinner for the exchange students, Adam, Isabel and I
  were standing in line to get some food, and Isabel turned to Adam and said,
  "Adamadamadamadamadam".<p>

  Meanwhile, Adam calmly replied, "Yes? May I help you?".<p>

  So I decided to make a song about it.<p>

  Adam said, "You can't have too many Adams in a song." I replied, "We'll see."<p>

  After writing the ground-breaking lyrics and recording a first draft
  of the song, I had Isabel sing her part. Then I invited Adam in to
  record him. "Say 'Yes?'", I told him, and he did so. Then I said,
  "Say 'Oh, ok.'", and he complied. "Ok!" I told him, "That will do."<p>

  He laughed as he looked at this big complicated Logic Pro project,
  and said, "Yeah, don't worry about any of the rest of this!"<p>

  When it was done, I played the song for him and the rest of the family
  and ever since then, our family has often said Adam more times than
  necessary when addressing him.<p>

  Instead of creating a music video to go with this song,
  I thought it would be fun to make a video game out of it,
  which I did for Adam's 31st birthday.
